# create-cpp-project

Simple command-line tool for quickly bootstrapping C++ projects in VS Code. Currently only setup for my desired preferences, check [TODO](#TODO) for coming changes to make this usable by the community and not just me.

## TODO

* [ ] Fix pathing (currently on creates project relative to create-cpp-project executable)
* [ ] Implement customizable file templates instead of hard-coded string literals
* [ ] Provide a more general/robust config setup (maybe read from an INI or something)
* [ ] Add a flag for launching VSCode automatically
